Introduction
------------
The game of Sim is played by two players on a board consisting of six dots ('vertices'). Each dot is connected to every other dot by a line. Two players take turns coloring any uncolored lines. One player colors in one color, and the other colors in another color, with each player trying to avoid the creation of a triangle made solely of their color; the player who completes such a triangle loses immediately.

This program uses a heuristic strategy to play the game of Sim against an opponent. References to the algorithm can be found in the book :
